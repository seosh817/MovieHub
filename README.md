# Project Configuration

## Setting up the API Key

This project requires The Movie Database (TMDB) API key to access external APIs. Follow the steps below to configure the API key:

1. Create a `local.properties` file in the project root directory.
2. Add the `TMDB_API_KEY` to the `local.properties` file as shown below:

    ```properties
    TMDB_API_KEY=your TMDB_API key
    ```
3. Build and run the project.

# TODO

- [x] Offline-first caching
- [ ] Add localization support (Korean, English, Japanese)
- [ ] Implement Media3 for video playback

# Inspiration

This project is developed with inspiration from the [The Movies2](https://github.com/skydoves/TheMovies2) project.
